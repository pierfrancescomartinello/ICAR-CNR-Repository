Classically, alignment methods are the de facto standard for such an assessment. In fact, considerable research efforts for the development of efficient algorithms, both on classic and parallel architectures, has been carried out in the past 50 years. Due to the growing amount of sequence data being produced, a new class of methods has emerged: Alignment-free methods. Research in this ares has become very intense in the past few years, stimulated by the advent of Next Generation Sequencing technologies, since those new methods are very appealing in terms of computational resources needed and biological relevance. Despite such an effort and in contrast with sequence alignment methods, no systematic investigation of how to take advantage of distributed architectures to speed up alignment-free methods, has taken place. We provide a contribution of that kind, by evaluating the possibility of using the Hadoop distributed framework to speed up the running times of these methods, compared to their original sequential formulation.","1530-2016","978-1-4673-7589-4","10.1109/ICPPW.2015.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349910","alignment-free sequence comparison and analysis;distributed computing;MapReduce;Hadoop","Bioinformatics;Computer architecture;Biology;Context;Electronic mail;Sequences;Pattern matching","","3","","33","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number is denoted by c(n,m) or approximated by (1+C)n, where C is a universal constant. The subscript 'online' is added when attention is restricted to online algorithms, and the superscript '1' is added when algorithms that find only one occurrence of the pattern in the text are considered. It is well known that n<or=c(n,m)<or=2n-m+1 or 0<or=C<or=1. These bounds are improved, and C/sub online/ is determined exactly.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-2082-X","10.1109/FSCS.1990.89532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=89532","","Upper bound;Pattern matching;Algorithm design and analysis;Mechanical factors;Computational complexity","","19","","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
