It argues that the development of AI is not just a technological leap but also a significant cultural and societal moment, akin to the advent of moving images that Walter Benjamin famously analyzed. The paper examines how AI, particularly in its current oligarchical and corporate-driven form, perpetuates and magnifies the existing social inequalities, thereby necessitating a critical and radical rethinking of its role in society and the arts. At the heart of the discussion is the concept of AI as a broad term encompassing various forms of machine intelligence, from natural language processing to computer vision. The paper criticizes the dominant anthropocentric view of intelligence and creativity, proposing a more inclusive approach that considers the diverse forms of intelligence present in other species and potentially in AI itself. It underscores the role of AI in shaping the art ecosystem, not just in the creative process but also in gatekeeping and decision-making. The paper proposes a framework for decolonizing AI in the art ecosystem, focusing on four key tasks: recognizing access as a form of power, understanding and addressing biases inherent in AI, assessing the impact of AI on marginalized communities, and challenging dominant narratives and epistemologies to create space for alternative voices and perspectives. It emphasizes the need for artists and the art community to engage actively with AI, shaping its development towards more equitable and just outcomes. In conclusion, the paper calls for a radical reimagination of AI's role in society and the arts, advocating for a future where AI is not just about technological advancement but also about fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and creatively diverse world. It invites artists, thinkers, and innovators to join in this journey of reimagining and reshaping the future of AI and the art ecosystem. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Agency; AI Art; And self-awareness; Art ecosystem; Art making; Artificial intelligence (AI); Augmented reality (AR); ChatGPT; Creativity; Critical thinking; Decolonization; Deep learning (DL); Extended reality (XR); Generative AI; Machine learning (ML); Virtual reality (VR)","Augmented reality; Decision making; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Agency; And self-awareness; Art ecosystem; Art making; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence art; Augmented reality; ChatGPT; Creativity; Critical thinking; Decolonization; Deep learning; Extended reality (XR); Generative artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Self awareness; Virtual reality; Virtual reality","2019 Another AI in Art Summit Catalog, (2019); Baeza-Yates R., Bias in web data and use taints the algorithms behind web-based applications, delivering equally biased results, Commun ACM, 61, 6, pp. 54-61, (2018); Baradaran A., Brielmaier I., Augmenting empathy and decolonizing AR/VR mediums: how do we reimagine augmented and virtual reality experiences?, Designing for empathy: perspectives on the museum experience, (2019); Bennett J., Vibrant matter: a political ecology of things, (2010); Beras E., When AI Misclassified Her Face, She Started a Movement for Accountability, (2020); Braidotti R., Posthuman critical theory, J Posthuman Stud, 1, 1, pp. 9-25, (2017); Brielmaier I., Accelerator series: technology, visual culture, and politics of representation, (2018); Broussard M., Artificial intelligence: how computers misunderstand the world, (2018); Deleuze G., Postscript on the societies of control, October, 59, pp. 3-7, (1992); Edmonds E., The art of interaction, Digit Creativity, 21, 4, pp. 257-264, (2010); Eubanks V., Automating inequality: how high-tech tools profile, police, and punish the poor, (2015); Feenberg A., Beira E., Technology, modernity, and democracy, (2018); Halberstam J., Livingston I., Posthuman bodies, (1995); Hardt M., Negri A., Empire, (2000); Hayles N.K., How we became posthuman: virtual bodies in cybernetics, literature, and informatics, (1999); Kaleagasi B., A New AI Can Write Music as Well as a Human Composer: The Future of Art Hangs in The Balance, (2020); Lewis S., Racial Bias in Photography, (2020); Massumi B., The autonomy of affect, Cult Crit, 31, pp. 83-109, (1995); Mignolo W., The darker side of Western modernity: global futures, decolonial options, (2011); Noble S., Algorithms of oppression: how search engines reinforce racism, (2018); O'Neil C., Weapons of math destruction: how big data increases inequality and threatens democracy, (2016); Popper F., From technological to virtual art, (2007); Russell S., Norvig P., Artificial intelligence: a modern approach, (2003); Light and dark, the racial biases that remain in photography, Tell Me More Staff, (2020); Tsukayama H., (2020); Decolonising the mind: the politics of language in African literature, (1986); Wachter-Boettcher S., Technically wrong: sexist apps, biased algorithms, and other threats of toxic tech, (2017); Watney C., A Framework for Increasing Competition and Diffusion in Artificial Intelligence, (2019); Zakardakis G., In our own image: Savior or destroyer?

Given the dynamic and evolving characteristics of the physical world, a huge volume of data transmission and exchange is necessary to attain synchronized updates in the virtual world. In this paper, we propose a semantic communication framework based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) to construct a virtual apple orchard with the aim of mitigating the costs associated with data transmission. Specifically, we first employ the YOLOv7-X object detector to extract semantic information from captured images of edge devices, thereby reducing the volume of transmitted data and saving transmission costs. Afterwards, we quantify the importance of each semantic information by the confidence generated through the object detector. Based on this, we propose two resource allocation schemes, i.e., the confidence-based scheme and the artificial intelligence-generated scheme, aimed at enhancing the transmission quality of important semantic information. The proposed diffusion model generates an optimal allocation scheme that outperforms both the average allocation scheme and the confidence-based allocation scheme. Moreover, to obtain semantic information more effectively, we enhance the detection capability of the YOLOv7-X object detector by introducing new Efficient Layer Aggregation Network-HorNet (ELAN-H) and SimAM attention modules, while reducing the model parameters and computational complexity, making it easier to run on edge devices with limited performance. The numerical results indicate that our proposed semantic communication framework and resource allocation schemes significantly reduce transmission costs while enhancing the transmission quality of important information in communication services.

Simultaneously, it becomes increasingly important to address emerging ramifications. Thereby, the focus is often set on ethical and safe design forestalling unintentional failures. However, cybersecurity-oriented approaches to AI safety additionally consider instantiations of intentional malice - including unethical malevolent AI design. Recently, an analogous emphasis on malicious actors has been expressed regarding security and safety for virtual reality (VR). In this vein, while the intersection of AI and VR (AIVR) offers a wide array of beneficial cross-fertilization possibilities, it is responsible to anticipate future malicious AIVR design from the onset on given the potential socio-psycho-technological impacts. For a simplified illustration, this paper analyzes the conceivable use case of Generative AI (here deepfake techniques) utilized for disinformation in immersive journalism. In our view, defenses against such future AIVR safety risks related to falsehood in immersive settings should be transdisciplinarily conceived from an immersive co-creation stance. As a first step, we motivate a cybersecurity-oriented procedure to generate defenses via immersive design fictions. Overall, there may be no panacea but updatable transdisciplinary tools including AIVR itself could be used to incrementally defend against malicious actors in AIVR.  © 2020 IEEE.","AI; AI Safety; Cybersecurity; Design Fiction; Disinformation; HCI; Immersive Journalism; Psychology; VR","Security of data; Virtual reality; Co-creation; Cross fertilization; Cyber security; Immersive; Immersive designs; Safe designs; Safety risks; Artificial intelligence","Dafoe A., AI Governance: A Research Agenda, (2018); Dignum V., AI is multidisciplinary, AI Matters, 5, 4, pp. 18-21, (2020); Hadfield-Menell D., Russell S.J., Abbeel P., Dragan A., Cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3909-3917, (2016); Leike J., Krueger D., Everitt T., Martic M., Maini V., Legg S., Scalable Agent Alignment Via Reward Modeling: A Research Direction, (2018); Peters D., Vold K., Robinson D., Calvo R.A., Responsible AI-Two frameworks for ethical design practice, IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, 1, 1, pp. 34-47, (2020); Soares N., Fallenstein B., Agent foundations for aligning machine intelligence with human interests: A technical research agenda, The Technological Singularity., pp. 103-125, (2017); Asilomar A., Principles.(2017), Principles Developed in Conjunction with the 2017 Asilomar Conference [Benevolent AI 2017], (2018); Aliman N.-M., Elands P., Hurst W., Kester L., Thorisson K.R., Werkhoven P., Yampolskiy R., Ziesche S., Error-correction for AI safety, International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence., pp. 12-22, (2020); Brundage M., Avin S., Clark J., Toner H., Eckersley P., Garfinkel B., Dafoe A., Scharre P., Zeitzoff T., Filar B., Et al., The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation, (2018); Pistono F., Yampolskiy R.V., Unethical Research: How to Create A Malevolent Artificial Intelligence, (2016); Yampolskiy R.V., Spellchecker M., Artificial Intelligence Safety and Cybersecurity: A Timeline of AI Failures, (2016); Pearlman K., Virtual Reality Brings Real Risks: Are We Ready?, (2020); Casey P., Baggili I., Yarramreddy A., Immersive virtual reality attacks and the human joystick, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, (2019); Gulhane A., Vyas A., Mitra R., Oruche R., Hoefer G., Valluripally S., Calyam P., Hoque K.A., Security, privacy and safety risk assessment for virtual reality learning environment applications, 2019 16th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC), pp. 1-9, (2019); Baldassi S., Kohno T., Roesner F., Tian M., Challenges and New Directions in Augmented Reality, Computer Security, and Neuroscience-part 1: Risks to Sensation and Perception, (2018); De Guzman J.A., Thilakarathna K., Seneviratne A., Security and privacy approaches in mixed reality: A literature survey, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 52, 6, pp. 1-37, (2019); Happa J., Glencross M., Steed A., Cyber security threats and challenges in collaborative mixed-reality, Frontiers in ICT, 6, (2019); 2019 Industry-Academia Summit on Mixed Reality Security, Privacy, and Safety: Summit Report, (2019); Yampolskiy R.V., Taxonomy of pathways to dangerous artificial intelligence, Workshops at the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2016); Wang M., Lyu X.-Q., Li Y.-J., Zhang F.-L., VR content creation and exploration with deep learning: A survey, Computational Visual Media, pp. 1-26, (2020); Bose A.J., Aarabi P., Virtual fakes: Deepfakes for virtual reality, 2019 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP).

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based generative methods provided complementary approaches for generating molecules under specific design constraints of relevance in drug design. The goal of our study is to incorporate protein 3D information directly into generative design by flexible docking plus an adapted protein-ligand scoring function, thereby moving towards automated structure-based design. First, the protein-ligand scoring function RFXscore integrating individual scoring terms, ligand descriptors, and combined terms was derived using the PDBbind database and internal data. Next, design results for different workflows are compared to solely ligand-based reward schemes. Our newly proposed, optimal workflow for structure-based generative design is shown to produce promising results, especially for those exploration scenarios, where diverse structures fitting to a protein binding site are requested. Best results are obtained using docking followed by RFXscore, while, depending on the exact application scenario, it was also found useful to combine this approach with other metrics that bias structure generation into “drug-like” chemical space, such as target-activity machine learning models, respectively.

However, part of this interest is due to its involvement in some data protection and data security issues. In the context of the ongoing debate surrounding similar technologies, such as generative AI, this contribution will first introduce the ""ChatGPT phenomenon"" (Sections 1 and 2). Then, it will analyse the various positions taken by some key stakeholders on the issues of above and the regulation of the design and use of such technologies, examining these perspectives through the lenses of “Digital Constitutionalism”. Particularly, this paper will emphasise the role that civil society can play in such dynamics (Section 3). Subsequently, it will further promote an active and forward-looking approach in addressing the looming threats these and other AI-based technologies could pose to fundamental rights and society as a whole (Section 4). As we already approach the next AI era without even noticing, the question worth asking ourselves is: “What will generative and AI-powered oracles reveal about us?” (Section 5). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Brain-computer interfaces; ChatGPT; Data protection; Fundamental rights; Generative AI; Privacy; Virtual reality","Data privacy; Interfaces (computer); Virtual reality; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Civil society; Ease-of-use; Fundamental right; Generative AI; Performance; Privacy; Security issues; Through the lens; Brain computer interface","Chen K., How can we imagine the generative AI's regulatory scheme? – Perspectives from Asia, (2023); EDPB resolves dispute on transfers by Meta and creates task force on Chat GPT, EDPB, (2023); Eliot L., AI ChatGPT as masterful manipulator of humans, worrying AI ethics and AI law, Forbes, (2023); Floridi L., Between a rock and a hard place: Elon Musk's open letter and the Italian ban of Chat-GPT, Onlife, (2023); Provvedimento del 30 marzo 2023 [9870832], GPDP, (2023); Gregory A., AI eye checks can predict heart disease risk in less than a minute, finds study, Guardian, (2022); Hu K., ChatGPT sets record for fastest-growing user base—Analyst note, Reuters, (2023); Iwanska K., Hide and seek: Polish DPA agrees that people should be able to access their advertising profiles, but there's no way to do so, (2022); Kay G., Elon Musk's brain-chip startup shares video it says shows a monkey telepathically ‘typing’ 1 Dec, Insider, (2022); Korff D., Georges M., Passenger name records, data mining & data protection: the need for strong safeguards, CoE Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data [T-PD(2015)11], pp. 29-30, (2015); Magid L., IBM, Microsoft and Amazon not letting police use their facial recognition technology, Forbes, (2020); O'Sullivan D., This man says he's stockpiling billions of our photos [video], (2020); G7 Hiroshima process on generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) – towards a G7 common understanding on generative AI, (2023); March 20 ChatGPT outage: here's what happened, OpenAI, (2023); Paul K., Singh M., Elon Musk's brain implant company is approved for human testing.

This problem is made extremely challenging due to the abundant presence of specular reflections. Most of the solutions proposed in the literature are based on filtering or masking out these regions as an additional processing step. There has been little investigation into explicitly learning robustness to such artefacts with single-step end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose an augmentation technique (CycleSTTN) that adds temporally consistent and realistic specularities to endoscopic videos. Such videos can act as ground truth data with known texture occluded behind the added specularities. We demonstrate that our image generation technique produces better results than a standard CycleGAN model. Additionally, we leverage this data augmentation to re-train a deep-learning based feature extractor (SuperPoint) and show that it improves. CycleSTTN code is made available here. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Deep Learning; Endoscopy; Generative AI; Specularity; Surgical AI; Surgical Data Science","Deep learning; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Motion estimation; Surgery; Textures; Camera-motion estimation; Computer assisted; Computer vision problems; Deep learning; Feature detection and matching; Generative AI; Specularities; Surgical AI; Surgical data science; Temporal models; Endoscopy","Asif M., Chen L., Song H., Yang J., Frangi A.F., An automatic framework for endoscopic image restoration and enhancement, Appl.

In intelligent transportation systems, the vehicular Metaverse can provide a fully immersive and hyperreal travel experience (e.g., via augmented reality head-up displays, AR-HUDs) to drivers and passengers in autonomous vehicles (AVs) through roadside units (RSUs). However, providing real-time and immersive services requires effective physical-virtual synchronization between AVs and virtual simulators. This paper proposes a generative AI-empowered physical-virtual synchronization framework for the vehicular Metaverse. In physical-to-virtual synchronization, digital twin (DT) tasks generated by AVs are offloaded for execution in RSUs with future route generation. In virtual-to-physical synchronization, virtual simulators customize diverse and personalized AR content via generative AI models based on user preferences. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to match and price AVs and virtual simulators for RSUs to provide real-time and effective services. Finally, property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is strategy-proof and adverse-selection free while increasing social surplus. © 2023 IEEE.","auction theory; augmented reality; digital twin; generative artificial intelligence; Vehicular Metaverse","Computation theory; Intelligent systems; Risk management; Synchronization; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Auction theory; Autonomous Vehicles; Generative artificial intelligence; Immersive; Metaverses; Real- time; Roadside units; Vehicular metaverse; Virtual simulators; Virtual synchronization; Augmented reality","Duan H., Li J., Fan S., Lin Z., Wu X., Cai W., Metaverse for social good: A university campus prototype, Proc. of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 153-161, (2021); Xu M., Ng W.C., Lim W.Y.B., Kang J., Xiong Z., Niyato D., Yang Q., Shen X.S., Miao C., A full dive into realizing the edgeenabled metaverse: Visions, enabling technologies, and challenges, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, (2022); Xu M., Niyato D., Wright B., Zhang H., Kang J., Xiong Z., Mao S., Han Z., Epvisa: Efficient auction design for real-time physical-virtual synchronization in the metaverse, (2022); Ren Y., Xie R., Yu F.R., Huang T., Liu Y., Quantum collective learning and many-to-many matching game in the metaverse for connected and autonomous vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 71, 11, pp. 12128-12139, (2022); Rombach R., Blattmann A., Lorenz D., Esser P., Ommer B., Highresolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models, Proc. of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 10684-10695, (2022); Ruiz N., Li Y., Jampani V., Pritch Y., Rubinstein M., Aberman K., Dreambooth: Fine tuning text-to-image diffusion models for subjectdriven generation, (2022); Xu M., Du H., Niyato D., Kang J., Xiong Z., Mao S., Han Z., Jamalipour A., Kim D.I., Leung V., Et al., Unleashing the power of edge-cloud generative ai in mobile networks: A survey of aigc services, (2023); Mathias M., Timofte R., Benenson R., Van Gool L., Traffic sign recognition-how far are we from the solution?, Proc. of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), (2013); Hui Y., Ma X., Su Z., Cheng N., Yin Z., Luan T.H., Chen Y., Collaboration as a service: Digital twins enabled collaborative and distributed autonomous driving, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9, 19, pp. 18607-18619, (2022); Arnosti N., Beck M., Milgrom P., Adverse selection and auction design for internet display advertising, American Economic Review, 106, 10, pp. 2852-2866, (2016); Ren P., Qiao X., Huang Y., Liu L., Pu C., Dustdar S., Chen J.-L., Edge ar x5: An edge-assisted multi-user collaborative framework for mobile web augmented reality in 5g and beyond, IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, 10, 4, pp. 2521-2537, (2022); Tran N.H., Bao W., Zomaya A., Nguyen M.N., Hong C.S., Federated learning over wireless networks: Optimization model design and analysis, Proc. of IEEE conference on computer communications, pp. 1387-1395, (2019); Tang M., Pang H., Wang S., Gao L., Huang J., Sun L., Multidimensional auction mechanisms for crowdsourced mobile video streaming, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 26, 5, pp. 2062-2075, (2018)","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174587312"

The objective of this research is to explore how a space can communicate with users in a seamless, engaging, and interactive environment. Therefore, it integrates natural language processing (NLP), generative artificial intelligence applications and human computer interaction that utilizes a combination of sensors, microphones, and cameras to collect real-time data on users' behavior, voice, and mood. This data is then processed and analyzed by an intelligent system that employs machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and adapt the environment accordingly. The adaptive features include changes in lighting, sound, and visual elements to facilitate creativity, focus, relaxation, or socialization, depending on the user's topics and emotional state. The paper discusses the technical aspects of implementing such a system. Additionally, it highlights the potential applications of this technology in various domains such as education, entertainment, and workplace settings. In conclusion, the immersive creative space represents a paradigm shift in human-environment interaction, offering a dynamic and personalized space that caters to the diverse needs of users. The research findings suggest that this innovative approach holds great promise for enhancing user experiences, fostering creativity, and promoting overall well-being.  © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Generative AI; Large Language Models; Virtual Reality","Human computer interaction; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; User interfaces; Generative AI; Immersive; Innovative approaches; Interactive Environments; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural languages; User behaviors; Working environment; Virtual reality","Al-Samarraie H., Hurmuzan S., A review of brainstorming techniques in higher education, InThinking Skills and Creativity, 27, pp. 78-91, (2018); Mandal S., Brief introduction of virtual reality & its challenges, International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 4, 4, pp. 304-309, (2013); Doerner R., Broll W., Grimm P., Jung B., Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR): Foundations and methods of extended realities (XR), Nature, (2022); Gong Z., Lee L.H., Soomro S.A., Nanjappan V., Georgiev G.V., A systematic review of virtual brainstorming from the perspective of creativity: Affordances, framework, and outlook, Digital Creativity, 33, 2, pp. 96-127, (2022); Carruth D.W., Virtual reality for education and workforce training, 2017 15th International Conference on Emerging ELearning Technologies and Applications (ICETA, pp. 1-6, (2017); He Z., Du R., Perlin K., CollaboVR: A Reconfigurable Framework for Creative Collaboration in Virtual Reality"", in, 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR), Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, pp. 542-554, (2020); Bourgeois-Bougrine S., Bonnardel N., Burkhardt J.M., Thornhill-Miller B., Pahlavan F., Buisine S., Guegan J., Pichot N., Lubart T., Immersive Virtual Environments?

However, current methods tend to apply edits to models globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce a method for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. This method allows users to selectively modify aesthetic segments of 3D models, without affecting the functional segments. To develop this method we first create a taxonomy of functionality in 3D models by qualitatively analyzing 1000 models sourced from a popular 3D printing repository, Thingiverse. With this taxonomy, we develop a semi-automatic classification method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. We propose a system called Style2Fab that allows users to selectively stylize 3D models without compromising their functionality. We evaluate the effectiveness of our classification method compared to human-annotated data, and demonstrate the utility of Style2Fab with a user study to show that functionality-aware segmentation helps preserve model functionality.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","3d printing; digital fabrication; generative AI.; personal fabrication","3D modeling; 3D printing; Fabrication; 'current; 3-D printing; 3D models; 3d-modeling; 3D-printing; Classification methods; Digital fabrication; Functional segments; Generative AI.; Personal fabrication; Taxonomies","Alcock C., Hudson N., Chilana P.K., Barriers to using, customizing, and printing 3d designs on thingiverse, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work, pp. 195-199, (2016); Bacher M., Whiting E., Bickel B., Olga S.-H., Spin-it: Optimizing moment of inertia for spinnable objects, ACM Trans.

Despite notable contributions and progress explaining Gen Z's behavior, significant gaps remain in our understanding of digital natives, their interactions with new-age technologies and how these technologies can be utilized to provide a better quality of life for this group of consumers. In this review article, we provide a background on Gen Z's consumer psychology and interactions with new-age technologies, followed by an overview of the articles published in our special section. Finally, we suggest new areas for future research on Gen Z's consumer psychology and interactions with new-age technologies. Specifically, we propose four main themes for future research in this area: (1) Gen Z and new-age technologies, specifically generative artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, the metaverse, virtual influencers, and live streaming; (2) Gen Z consumers and global issues, specifically economic and social issues, sustainability and environmental issues, and health and wellbeing; (3) combining theories, concepts and disciplines to understand Gen Z and new-age technologies; and (4) new methods and forms of collaboration. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Generation Z; generative AI; live streaming; metaverse; psychology; quantum computing","","Al-Sharafi M.A., Al-Emran M., Arpaci I., Iahad N.A., AlQudah A.A., Iranmanesh M., Al-Qaysi N., Generation Z use of artificial intelligence products and its impact on environmental sustainability: A cross-cultural comparison, Computers in Human Behavior, 143, (2023); Ameen N., Anand A., Gen Z in the United Arab Emirates: A smart-tech-driven iGeneration, The new Gen Z in Asia: Dynamics, differences, digitalisation, pp. 181-192, (2020); Ameen N., Cheah J.H., Kumar S., It's all part of the customer journey: The impact of augmented reality, chatbots, and social media on the body image and self-esteem of Gen Z female consumers, Psychology & Marketing, 39, 11, pp. 2110-2129, (2022); Ameen N., Hosany S., Taheri B., (2021); Ameen N., Sharma G.D., Tarba S., Rao A., Chopra R., Toward advancing theory on creativity in marketing and artificial intelligence, Psychology & Marketing, 39, 9, pp. 1802-1825, (2022); Ameen N., Viglia G., Altinay L., Revolutionizing services with cutting-edge technologies post major exogenous shocks, The Service Industries Journal, 43, 4, pp. 125-133, (2023); Ang T., Wei S., Anaza N.A., Livestreaming vs pre-recorded: How social viewing strategies impact consumers' viewing experiences and behavioral intentions, European Journal of Marketing, 52, 10, pp. 2075-2104, (2018); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

These models are capable of a wide range of activities, including providing general answers and producing creative representations. They have a significant impact on a variety of businesses and society since they have the ability to transform established work roles. Generative AI may, for instance, convert text into images using the DALLE-2 model, 3D images using the Dreamfusion model, photos into text using the Flamingo model, and even text into video using the Phenaki model. While ChatGPT can translate text into other texts, the AudioLM model can translate text into audio. Text is converted into code by the Codex model and scientific texts using the Galactica model.

Encoding the high-dimensional HRTFs to a sub-dimensional space has proven to be useful in many previous research efforts in predicting individualized HRTFs. In this work, we provide a comparative study of some traditional methods such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based Autoencoders and the more recent generative deep learning approaches such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) for learning HRTF representations. We further demonstrate the benefits of using 3D-CNNs for this task to learn correlations between neighboring HRTFs, along both spatial and frequency dimensions. To this end, we provide evidence suggesting that such a 3D-CNN based approach enables the derived latent space to encode features more representative of the individuality of the HRTFs while also allowing for the representations to be significantly more compact. Finally, we also explore the advantages of such robust representations towards downstream applications of predicting Individualized HRTFs. © 2023 IEEE.","Generative AI; HRTF Modeling; PCA; Representation Learning; VQVAE","Deep learning; Encoding (symbols); Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Principal component analysis; Signal encoding; Transfer functions; Auto encoders; Generative AI; Head related transfer function; Head related transfer function modeling; Learning approach; Principle components analysis; Representation learning; Transfer function modeling; Transfer functions representations; VQVAE; Convolutional neural networks","Wenzel E.M., Arruda M., Kistler D.J., Wightman F.L., Localization using nonindividualized head-related transfer functions, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 94, 1, pp. 111-123, (1993); Zotkin D., Hwang J., Duraiswaini R., Davis L.S., Hrtf personalization using anthropometric measurements, 2003 IEEE workshop on applications of signal processing to audio and acoustics (IEEE Cat.

Traditional materials engineering education has often relied on a transmission teaching approach, in which students are expected to passively receive information from instructors. However, this approach has shown to be inadequate under the current circumstances, in which information is readily available and innovative tools such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality environments are becoming widespread (e.g., metaverse). Instead, we consider that a critical goal of education should be to develop aptitudes and abilities that enable students to generate solutions and products that address societal demands. In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering. It also allows them to make informed decisions within the circular bioeconomy framework, benefiting society by promoting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies and practices. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Artificial intelligence; Biobased; ChatGPT; Chemical engineering; Engineering education; Formulation; Generative AI; Materials","Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Learning systems; Students; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; Bio-based; Bio-based materials; ChatGPT; Chemical engineering education; Formulation; Generative AI; Learning strategy; Material engineering; Teaching approaches; Traditional materials; Engineering education","Abad-Segura E., Gonzalez-Zamar M.-D., Sustainable economic development in higher education institutions: a global analysis within the SDGs framework, J.

As virtual agents and robots continue to become part of our daily lives, the need for them to efficiently convey emotion and intent increases. When trained to dance, to what extent can AI learn to model the tacit mappings between sound and motion? Here, we explore the creative capacity of a generative model trained on 3D motion capture recordings of improvised dance. We perform a perceptual judgment experiment wherein respondents rate movement generated by our model as well as human performances. While the sound-motion mappings remain somewhat elusive, particularly when compared to examples of human dance, our study shows that in certain aspects related to perceived dance-likeness and expressivity, the model successfully mimics human dance movement. By employing a perceptual study to evaluate our generative model, we aim to further our ability to understand the affordances and limitations of creative AI.  © 2021 ACM.","Dance; Embodied Music Cognition; Generative AI; Mixture Density Networks; Perceptual judgement experiment","Mapping; 3D motion capture; Affordances; Daily lives; Dance movement; Generative model; Human performance; Motion mapping; Virtual agent; 3D modeling","Alluri V., Toiviainen P., 2010.

The objective is to gain insights into the emerging applications of VR/AR in mental health interventions and their potential impact on patient outcomes. The review also includes personal observations on the effectiveness and challenges associated with VR/AR simulations and the rise of exciting, disruptive artificial intelligence large language models. The findings of this review contribute to the understanding of the current state of VR/AR technology in mental health and highlight potential future directions in this rapidly evolving field. Recent Findings: Recent studies have shown that VR/AR simulation is an effective and promising approach for treating various anxiety disorders, including specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Simulated environments can be tailored to induce provoking situations, allowing individuals to learn from and gradually confront and grow in controlled and safe environments. Summary: Recent findings in the field of virtual reality simulations in mental health indicate that VR/AR exposure therapy is effective for treating anxiety disorders, while interventions show promise in improving social skills in individuals working with patients. In a broader sense, the use of VR/AR as an educational tool shows enormous potential now that functional generative artificial intelligence (AI) is recently available. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Avatars; Extended reality; Generative AI; Large language models; Simulation; Virtual reality","Anxiety Disorders; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Language; Mental Health; Phobia, Social; artificial intelligence; augmented reality; cognitive therapy; communication skill; cybersickness; drug dependence; electroencephalography; emotion; experiential learning; human; intervention study; medical education; mental health; natural language processing; personalized medicine; phobia; posttraumatic stress disorder; problem solving; Review; social phobia; software; treatment outcome; treatment planning; virtual reality; virtual reality based cognitive therapy; virtual reality exposure therapy; wellbeing; anxiety disorder; artificial intelligence; language; mental health; social phobia","Yin J., Hinchet R., Shea H., Majidi C., Wearable soft technologies for haptic sensing and feedback, Adv Func Mater, 31, 39, (2020); Kothgassner O.D., Goreis A., Kafka J.X., van Eickels R.L., Plener P.L., Felnhofer A., Virtual reality exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): A meta-analysis, Eur J Psychotraumatol, 10, 1, (2019); Botella C., Fernandez-Alvarez J., Guillen V., Garcia-Palacios A., Banos R., Recent progress in virtual reality exposure therapy for phobias: a systematic review, Curr Psychiatry Rep, 19, 7, (2017); Powers M.B., Emmelkamp P.M.G., Virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis, J Anxiety Disord, 22, 3, pp. 561-569, (2008); Goldenhersch E., Thrul J., Ungaretti J., Rosencovich N., Waitman C., Ceberio M.R., Virtual reality smartphone-based intervention for smoking cessation: Pilot randomized controlled trial on initial clinical efficacy and adherence, J Med Int Res, 22, 7, (2020); Asad M.M., Naz A., Churi P., Tahanzadeh M.M., Virtual reality as pedagogical tool to enhance experiential learning: A systematic literature review, Educ Res Int, (2021); Li Y.J., Luo H., Zhang C., Empathy games for depression using virtual reality: A literature review and a study design, Proceedings of the 54Th Hawaii International Conference on System Science., (2021); Lohr D., Johnson S., Aziz S., Komogortsev O., Demonstrating eye movement biometrics in virtual reality., (2023); Childs E., Mohammad F., Stevens L., Burbelo H., Awoke A., Rewkowski N., Manocha D., An Overview of Enhancing Distance Learning through Augmented and Virtual Reality Technologies, (2023); Reger G.M., Smolenski D., Edwards-Stewart A., Skopp N.A., Rizzo A.S., Norr A., Does virtual reality increase simulator sickness during exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, Telemed J E Health, 25, 9, pp. 859-861, (2019); Lui P.P., Stringer E., Jouriles E.N., Advancing knowledge on the health consequences of discrimination: the potential of virtual reality, Cultur Divers Ethnic Minor Psychol, (2021); O'Connor S., Virtual reality and avatars in health care, Clin Nurs Res, 28, 5, pp. 523-528, (2019); Carlson C., Singh A., de Peralta T., Kennedy S., Kassebaum D., Emotional VRavatars as a learning tool in dental education 2022.; Yin K., He Z., Xiong J., Zou J., Li K., Wu S.-T., Virtual reality and augmented reality displays: Advances and future perspectives, Journal of Physics: Photonics., (2021); Caponnetto P., Triscari S., Maglia M., Quattropani M.C., The simulation game—virtual reality therapy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder: a systematic review, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 18, 24, (2021); Lohre R., Bois A.J., Athwal G.S., Goel D.P., Improved complex skill acquisition by immersive virtual reality training, J Bone Joint Surg, 102, 6, (2020); Korngiebel D.M., Mooney S.D., Considering the possibilities and pitfalls of generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3) in healthcare delivery, Npj Digi Med, 4, 1, (2021); Soret R., Montes-Solano A.-M., Manzini C., Peysakhovich V., Fabre E.F., Pushing open the door to reality: on facilitating the transitions from virtual to real environments, Appl Ergon, 97, (2021); Nichols S., Physical ergonomics of virtual environment use, Appl Ergon, 30, 1, pp. 79-90, (1999); Nichols S., Patel H., Health and safety implications of virtual reality: a review of empirical evidence, Appl Ergon, 33, 3, pp. 251-271, (2002)","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168960469"

Empirical findings have shown promising outcomes such as augmented human cognition and highly creative design products. Barriers still remain that prevent individuals from perceiving and adopting AI, entering into collaboration with AI and sustaining it over time. It is even more challenging for creative design industries to adopt and trust AI where these professionals value individual style and expression, and therefore require highly personalized and specialized AI assistance. In this paper, we present a holistic hybrid intelligence (HI) approach for individual experts to train and personalize their GD assistants on the fly. Our contribution to human-AI interaction is three-fold including i) a programmable common language between human and AI to represent the expert's design goals to the generative algorithm, ii) a human-centered continual training loop to seamlessly integrate AI-training into the expert's task workflow, iii) a hybrid intelligence narrative to address the psychological willingness to spend time and effort training such a virtual assistant. This integral approach enables individuals to directly communicate design goals to AI and seeks to create a psychologically safe space for adopting, training and improving AI without the fear of job-replacement. We concertize these constructs through a newly developed Hybrid Intelligence Technology Acceptance Model (HI-TAM). We used mixed methods to empirically evaluate this approach through the lens of HI-TAM with 8 architectural professionals working individually with a GD assistant to co-create floor plan layouts of office buildings. We believe that the proposed approach enables individual professionals, even non-technical ones, to adopt and trust AI-enhanced co-creative tools. © 2023 The Authors.","Co-creation; Communication; Human AI language; Partnership; Personalization; Technology Acceptance Model; Tool adoption; Training generative AI assistants","Office buildings; Product design; Virtual reality; Co-creation; Generative design; Human AI language; Hybrid intelligence; Hybrid intelligence approaches; Partnership; Personalizations; Technology acceptance model; Tool adoption; Training generative AI assistant; Virtual addresses","Kazi R.H., Grossman T., Cheong H., Hashemi A., Fitzmaurice G., DreamSketch: Early Stage 3D Design Explorations with Sketching and Generative Design, Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, pp. 401-414, (2017); Keshavarzi M., Hotson C., Cheng C.Y., Nourbakhsh M., Bergin M., Rahmani Asl M., SketchOpt: Sketch-Based Parametric Model Retrieval for Generative Design, Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems., (2021); Demirel H.O., Goldstein M.H., Li X., Sha Z., Human-Centered Generative Design Framework: An Early Design Framework to Support Concept Creation and Evaluation, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, 2023, pp. 1-12; Rafner J., Dellermann D., Hjorth A., Veraszto D., Kampf C., Mackay W., Et al., Deskilling, Upskilling, and Reskilling: a Case for Hybrid Intelligence, Morals & Machines, 1, 2, pp. 24-39, (2022); Study Finds Significant Financial Benefits with AI; 2020; Shneiderman B., Bridging the gap between ethics and practice: guidelines for reliable, safe, and trustworthy human-centered AI systems, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 10, 4, pp. 1-31; Dellermann D., Ebel P., Sollner M., Leimeister J.M., Hybrid Intelligence, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 61, pp. 637-643, (2019); Amershi S., Cakmak M., Knox W.B., Kulesza T., Power to the people: The role of humans in interactive machine learning, Ai Magazine, 35, 4, pp. 105-120, (2014); Rafner J., Bantle C., Dellermann D., Sollner M., Zaggl M.A., Sherson J., Towards Hybrid Intelligence Workflows: Integrating Interface Design and Scalable Deployment, HHAI2022: Augmenting Human Intellect, pp. 310-313, (2022); Shea K., Aish R., Gourtovaia M., Towards integrated performance-driven generative design tools, Automation in Construction, 14, 2, pp. 253-264, (2005); Oh S., Jung Y., Kim S., Lee I., Kang N., Deep generative design: Integration of topology optimization and generative models, Journal of Mechanical Design, 141, 11, (2019); Caetano I., Santos L., Leitao A., Computational design in architecture: Defining parametric, generative, and algorithmic design, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 9, 2, pp. 287-300, (2020); Nagy D., Villaggi L., Benjamin D., Generative urban design: integration of financial and energy design goals in a generative design workflow for residential neighborhood layout, Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design, 3, (2018); Alcaide-Marzal J., Diego-Mas J.A., Acosta-Zazueta G., A 3D shape generative method for aesthetic product design, Design Studies, 66, pp. 144-176, (2020); Kepuska V., Bohouta G., Next-generation of virtual personal assistants (microsoft cortana, apple siri, amazon alexa and google home), 2018 IEEE 8th annual computing and communication workshop and conference (CCWC), pp. 99-103, (2018); Dubiel M., Halvey M., Azzopardi L., A survey investigating usage of virtual personal assistants; Maedche A., Morana S., Schacht S., Werth D., Krumeich J., Advanced user assistance systems, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 58, pp. 367-370, (2016); Yuan X., Chen Y., Zhao Y., Long Y., Liu X., Chen K., Et al., Commandersong: A systematic approach for practical adversarial voice recognition, 27th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 18), pp. 49-64, (2018); Borji A., A Categorical Archive of ChatGPT Failures; Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Baroni I., Calegari G.R., Scandolari D., Celino I., AI-TAM: a model to investigate user acceptance and collaborative intention in human-in-the-loop AI applications, Human Computation, 9, 1, pp. 1-21, (2022); Zanzotto F.M., Human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 64, pp. 243-252, (2019); Salovaara A., Tamminen S., Acceptance or appropriation?

The current scope and predicted growth of the world digital population is considered in light of Big Tech companies' domination of social media as well as continuing digital exclusion. The ethical studies’ landscape is mapped by looking at comparative studies in this relatively new field and with the aim of establishing a suitable ethic principles baseline for such socially aligned networks further illustrated by human–AI interface case studies. Beyond establishing a suitable ethic principles baseline for such socially aligned networks, current advances in neuroethics are considered within the context of emotional AI and human–AI interactions. Neuroethics principles are considered within the context of different philosophical schools, leading to a discussion of relatively new neurorights. An interconnection of morality, ethics, and spirituality is discussed, together with immature legal frameworks and ethical boundaries for Internet of things (IoT) devices. In conclusion, neuroethics are considered a suitable blueprint for socially aligned networks and highlighting that regulation alone is likely not going to be sufficient on its own, particularly when considering the rapid growth of generative AI. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents an early iteration of a co-creative system that uses generative AI to change, suggest, and provide feedback on a 3D rendering's materials. The system is aimed to be used during design review sessions to assist designers in quickly exploring alternatives, and converging on suitable materials before construction. We first interviewed industrial designers on how they assess materials in various deliverables (e.g., sketches, and 3D renderings) during design review sessions. Based on our findings, we then develop a prototype of the co-creative system for generating, suggesting, and providing feedback on a 3D rendering's material textures. We believe that using this system can assist designers in not only creating textures for their 3D renderings but also in providing material-aware feedback to create the product feasibly. © 2023 ACM.","generative AI; industrial design; texture transfer","Textures; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3-D rendering; Creative systems; Design review; Generative AI; Industrial designers; Materials selection; Review sessions; Sensory characteristics; Sketch renderings; Texture transfer; Product design","Asbjorn Sorensen C., Jagtap S., Warell A., Material Selection in Industrial Design Education-a Literature Review, pp. 708-713, (2016); Ashby M., Johnson K., The art of materials selection, Materials Today, 6, 12, pp. 24-35, (2003); Bi S., Khademi Kalantari N., Ramamoorthi R., Patch-based optimization for image-based texture mapping, Acm Transactions on Graphics, 36, (2017); Brown T.B., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Sandhini Agarwal A., Herbert-Voss A., Krueger G., Henighan T., Child R., Ramesh A., Ziegler D.M., Wu J., Winter C., Hesse C., Chen M., Sigler E., Litwin M., Gray S., Chess B., Clark J., Berner C., McCandlish S., Radford A., Sutskever I., Amodei D., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2020); Dream-textures: Stable Diffusion Built-in to the Blender Shader, (2022); Anthony Chen X., Tao Y., Wang G., Kang R., Forte : User-Driven Generative Design, Chi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-12, (2018); Chen Y., Chen R., Lei J., Zhang Y., Jia K., TANGO: Text-driven Photorealistic and Robust 3D Stylization via Lighting Decomposition, NeurIPS, pp. 1-13, (2022); Goodfellow I., Pouget-Abadie J., Mirza M., Xu B., Warde-Farley D., Ozair S., Courville A., Bengio Y., Generative adversarial networks, Commun.

A large number of cameras continuously record the video, creating a massive amount of data. It takes a lot of time, labor, hardware storage, and other resources to process these massive amounts of video. This process has been revolutionized in recent years through the development of generative models. In this sense, video summarization is significant. In this study, we used two different kinds of approach Speech transcript-based approach and the action-based approach for summarization and creation. This paper's primary objective is to obtain the user's video URL to offer them a summary and a shortened version of the original video. Additionally, if there is only music or no transcript in the video, this will tell you which actions are performed in the video and provide you with a shortened version of that video, according to the activity and actions in the video. Image generation is the process of creating new images that do not exist in the real-world using computer algorithms. With Image generation option, users can create new and unique images that do not exist in the real world. © 2023 IEEE.","Article Summarization; Image Generation; Video Generation; Video Summarization; VidSumGen","Video recording; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Article summarization; Generative model; Image generations; Real-world; Training data; Video generation; Video summarization; Vidsumgen; Digital storage","Burhan Ul Haq H., Asif M., Bin Ahmad M., Video Summarization Techniques: A Review, International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research, 9, 11, (2020); Raksha H., Namitha G., Sejal N., Action-based Video Summarization, TENCON 2019-2019 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON), pp. 457-462, (2019); Soomro K., Zamir A., Shah M., UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild, (2012); Bhagwatkar R., Bachu S., Fitter K., Kulkarni A., Chiddarwar S., A Review of Video Generation Approaches, 2020 International Conference on Power, Instrumentation, Control and Computing (PICC), pp. 1-5, (2020); Luthra V., Basak J., Chaudhury S., Jyothi K.A.N., Electrical Engineering Department Indian Institute of Technology; Ajmal M., Ashraf M., Shakir M., Video Summarization: Techniques and Classification, pp. 1-13, (2012); Kingma D.P., Dhariwal P., Glow: Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2019), (2019); Radford A., Metz L., Chintala S., Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2016), (2016); Zou Z., Zou Y., Ling H., Text2Vid: Generating Animated Video from Textual Scenes, ICCV, (2019); Suwajanakorn S., Seitz S.M., Kemelmacher-Shlizerman I., Few-Shot Adversarial Learning of Realistic Neural Talking Head Models, CVPR, (2020); Varol G., Laptev I., Schmid C., Long-term temporal convolutions for action recognition, IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 40, 6, pp. 1510-1517, (2017); Qiao T., Zhang J., Xu D., Tao D., Mirrorgan: Learning text-to-image generation by redescription, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1505-1514, (2019); Taskiran C.M., Pizlo Z., Amir A., Ponceleon D., Delp E.J., Automated video program summarization using speech transcripts, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 8, 4, pp. 775-791, (2006)","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175654695"

In this changing scenario, this article reviews the literature on evolving criteria for quality assessment in secondary education using a four-step PRISMA flow chart for identification, screening, eligibility determination, and inclusion of data from the Scopus database and by employing quantitative and qualitative synthesis. The quantitative analysis found that Lim, W.M. is the eminent author; Quality Assurance in Education is the most popular journal; and the United States and the United Kingdom are the major contributing countries to this field. The evolving criteria for quality assessment in the rapidly emerging virtual and distance learning can be centred around five major themes: technological infrastructure, ICT competency, and adaptability, pedagogy for online education, collaboration, partnership, and motivation, as well as a blended learning environment. Thus, this study contributes to the existing theory by mapping the gaps and highlighting emerging themes for assessing education quality. This paper also supplies evidence to the educationists and policy-makers that help them formulate time-bound policy and to the researchers suggesting the need to develop valid and reliable measurement indicators for the evolving quality assessment criteria in the post-COVID era. This review has also proposed the future research agenda on applying generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) like ChatGPT, ChatSonic, Jasper Chat, and metaverse (Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook) technologies in secondary education for quality enhancement. © 2023 The Authors","Assessment; COVID-19; Criteria; Quality; Secondary education; Systematic review","","Ahmed M.M., Aini H.H., Fatimah T., Kamal H.M., The challenges of secondary level business education in Bangladesh, Journal Pendidikan, 22, 1, pp. 53-64, (2021); Ahmed V., Opoku A., Technology supported learning and pedagogy in times of crisis: The case of COVID-19 pandemic, Education and Information Technologies, 27, 1, pp. 365-405, (2022); Akhter Z., Quality assurance in secondary education program of Bangladesh open university: Present status and challenges, Online Submission, 9, 2, pp. 35-45, (2008); Almonacid-Fierro A., Philominraj A., Vargas-Vitoria R., Almonacid-Fierro M., Perceptions about teaching in times of COVID-19 pandemic: Experience of secondary education in Chile, Perceptions about Teaching in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of Secondary Education in Chile, 11, 1, pp. 457-467, (2021); Astatke M., Weng C., Chen S., A literature review of the effects of social networking sites on secondary school students' academic achievement, Interactive Learning Environments, 29, 1, pp. 1-17, (2021); Astin A.W., Four critical years, Effects of college on beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge, (1977); Astin A.W., What matters in college?

Assisted by digital twin (DT) technologies, connected autonomous vehicles (AVs), roadside units (RSUs), and virtual simulators can maintain the vehicular MR Metaverse via simulations for sharing data and making driving decisions collaboratively. However, it is challenging and costly to enable large-scale traffic and driving simulation via realistic data collection and fusion from the physical world for online prediction and offline training in autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose an autonomous driving architecture, where generative AI is leveraged to synthesize unlimited conditioned traffic and driving data via simulations for improving driving safety and traffic control efficiency. First, we propose a multi-task DT offloading model for the reliable execution of heterogeneous DT tasks with different requirements at RSUs. Then, based on the preferences of AV's DTs and real-world data, virtual simulators can synthesize unlimited conditioned driving and traffic datasets for improved robustness. Finally, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to provide fine-grained incentives for RSUs on providing resources for autonomous driving. The property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and architecture are strategy-proof and effective.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.","auction theory; Autonomous driving; generative artificial intelligence; Metaverse","Autonomous vehicles; Job analysis; Mixed reality; Online systems; Auction theory; Autonomous driving; Autonomous Vehicles; Computational modelling; Generative artificial intelligence; Metaverses; Mixed reality; Roadside units; Task analysis; Computation theory","Zhou P., Et al., Vetaverse: Technologies, Applications, and Visions Toward the Intersection of Metaverse, Vehicles, and Transportation Systems, (2022); Zhang H., Mao S., Niyato D., Han Z., Location-dependent augmented reality services in wireless edge-enabled metaverse systems, IEEE Open J.

However, current methods tend to apply edits to models globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce Style2Fab, a system for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements, and selectively modifying the aesthetic segments, without affecting the functional segments. Style2Fab uses a semi-automatic classification method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements, and differentiable rendering to selectively stylize the functional segments. We demonstrate the functionality of this tool with six application examples across domains of Home Interior Design, Medical Applications, and Personal Accessories. © 2023 Owner/Author.","3d printing; digital fabrication; generative AI.; personal fabrication","3D modeling; Architectural design; Fabrication; Medical applications; Three dimensional computer graphics; 'current; 3-D printing; 3D models; 3d-modeling; 3D-printing; Digital fabrication; Functional segments; Generative AI.; Personal fabrication; Physical world; 3D printing","Alcock C., Hudson N., Chilana P.K., Barriers to using, customizing, and printing 3d designs on thingiverse, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP '16), pp. 195-199, (2016); Buehler E., Branham S., Ali A., Chang J.J., Hofmann M.K., Hurst A., Kane S.K., Sharing is caring: Assistive technology designs on thingiverse, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '15), pp. 525-534, (2015); Thingiverse -Digital Designs for Physical Objects, (2023); Faruqi F., Friedman K., Cheng L., Wessely M., Subramanian S., Mueller S., SliceHub: Augmenting Shared 3D Model Repositories with Slicing Results for 3D Printing, (2021); Hofmann M., Hann G., Hudson S.E., Mankof J., Greater than the sum of its parts: Expressing and reusing design intent in 3d models, Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '18), pp. 1-12, (2018); Hofmann M., Williams K., Kaplan T., Valencia S., Hann G., Hudson S.E., Mankof J., Carrington P., Occupational therapy is making: Clinical rapid prototyping and digital fabrication, Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '19), pp. 1-13, (2019); Kato H., Beker D., Morariu M., Ando T., Matsuoka T., Kehl W., Gaidon A., Diferentiable Rendering: A Survey, (2020); Kuznetsov S., Paulos E., Rise of the expert amateur: Diy projects, communities, and cultures, Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Extending Boundaries (NordiCHI '10).

The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.  © ; 2023 The Authors.","AI-generated content; Artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence of things; distributed system; edge-cloud computing; lightweight models; metaverse","Biological systems; Cloud computing; Electric power transmission; Artificial intelligence of thing; Artificial intelligence-generated content; Biological system modeling; Chatbots; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Distributed systems; Edge clouds; Edge-cloud computing; Lightweight model; Metaverses; Artificial intelligence","Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., An overview of chatbot technology, Proc.

However, deploying these models on mobile devices is challenging due to resource constraints and user demand for real-Time performance. We take a first step towards understanding the bottlenecks by performing a measurement study of three recent text-To-3D generative models (Point-E, Shap-E, and CLIP-Mesh) in terms of their runtime GPU memory usage, latency, and synthesis quality. We investigate the effectiveness of quantization and distillation techniques to overcome these challenges by speeding up inference execution, potentially at the expense of quality. We find that the Shap-E model is promising for mobile deployment, but requires further optimization in its bottleneck diffusion step for real-Time performance, as well as reduced memory usage and load times. Further work is needed on custom optimizations for generative text-To-3D models, including targeting specific metrics at each computation stage, efficient representations of 3D objects, and adaptive network and system support for resource-hungry models.  © 2023 Owner/Author(s).","generative AI; GPU memory; latency; mobile devices; text-To-3D","Distillation; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D object; Generative AI; Generative model; GPU memory; Latency; Memory usage; Optimisations; Real time performance; Resource Constraint; Text-to-3d; Graphics processing unit","Barron J.T., Mildenhall B., Tancik M., Hedman P., Martin-Brualla R., Srinivasan P.P., Mip-nerf: A Multiscale Representation for Anti-Aliasing Neural Radiance Fields, (2021); Chen D., Mei J., Zhang H., Yan Feng C., Chen C., Knowledge Distillation with the Reused Teacher Classifier, (2022); Chen X., Fang H., Lin T., Vedantam R., Gupta S., Dollar P., Lawrence Zitnick C., Microsoft Coco Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server, (2015); Chen Z., Funkhouser T., Hedman P., Tagliasacchi A., Mobilenerf: Exploiting the Polygon Rasterization Pipeline for Efficient Neural Field Rendering on Mobile Architectures, (2023); Gao J., Shen T., Wang Z., Chen W., Yin K., Li D., Litany O., Gojcic Z., Fidler S., Get3d: A generative model of high quality 3d textured shapes learned from images, NeurIPS, (2022); Guan Y., Zheng C., Zhang X., Guo Z., Jiang J., Pano: Optimizing 360 video streaming with a better understanding of quality perception, ACM SIGCOMM, (2019); Han B., Liu Y., Qian F., ViVo: Visibility-Aware mobile volumetric video streaming, ACM MobiCom, (2020); Hasselgren J., Munkberg J., Lehtinen J., Aittala M., Laine S., Appearance-Driven Automatic 3D Model Simplification, Eurographics Symposium on Rendering, (2021); Huang T., You S., Wang F., Qian C., Xu C., Knowledge Distillation from A Stronger Teacher, (2022); Jain A., Mildenhall B., Barron J.T., Abbeel P., Poole B., Zero-shot Text-guided Object Generation with Dream Fields, (2022); Jun H., Nichol A., Shap-e: Generating Conditional 3d Implicit Functions, (2023); Lee K., Yi J., Lee Y., FarfetchFusion: Towards Fully Mobile Live 3D Telepresence Platform ACM MobiCom, (2023); Li X., Lian L., Liu Y., Yang H., Dong Z., Kang D., Zhang S., Keutzer K., Q-diffusion: Quantizing Diffusion Models, (2023); MacRumors, Apple Now Seeking Generative AI Engineers for AR/VR Applications, (2023); Mildenhall B., Srinivasan P.P., Tancik M., Barron J.T., Ramamoorthi R., Ng R., Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis, Commun ACM 65, 1, 2021, pp. 99-106, (2021); Mohammad Khalid N., Xie T., Belilovsky E., Popa T., CLIP-Mesh: Generating Textured Meshes from Text Using Pretrained Image-Text Models, (2022); Moller T., Evans A., Schied C., Keller A., Instant neural graphics primitives with a multiresolution hash encoding, ACM Transactions on Graphics 41, 4, 2022, pp. 1-15, (2022); Nichol A., Dhariwal P., Ramesh A., Shyam P., Mishkin P., McGrew B., Sutskever I., Chen M., Glide: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-guided Diffusion Models, (2021); Nichol A., Jun H., Dhariwal P., Mishkin P., Chen M., Point-E: A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts, (2022); Huk Park D., Azadi S., Liu X., Darrell T., Rohrbach A., Benchmark for compositional text-To-image synthesis, NeurIPS, (2021); Poole B., Jain A., Barron J.T, Mildenhall B., Dreamfusion: Text-To-3d Using 2d Diffusion, (2022); PyTorch, Dynamic Quantization, (2023); Radford A., Wook Kim J., Hallacy C., Ramesh A., Goh G., Agarwal S., Sastry G., Askell A., Mishkin P., Clark J., Et al., Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision, ICML, (2021); Ran X., Chen H., Zhu X., Liu Z., Chen J., Deepdecision: A mobile deep learning framework for edge video analytics, IEEE INFOCOM 2018-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications.

In engineering design and optimization, evaluating engineering metrics is crucial. To make generative models performance-aware and enable them to create high-performing designs, surrogate modeling of these metrics is necessary. However, the currently used representations of three-dimensional (3D) shapes either require extensive computational resources to learn or suffer from significant information loss, which impairs their effectiveness in surrogate modeling. To address this issue, we propose a new two-dimensional (2D) representation of 3D shapes. We develop a surrogate drag model based on this representation to verify its effectiveness in predicting 3D car drag. We construct a diverse dataset of 9,070 high-quality 3D car meshes labeled by drag coefficients computed from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to train our model. Our experiments demonstrate that our model can accurately and efficiently evaluate drag coefficients with an R2value above 0.84 for various car categories. Moreover, the proposed representation method can be generalized to many other product categories beyond cars. Our model is implemented using deep neural networks, making it compatible with recent AI image generation tools (such as Stable Diffusion) and a significant step towards the automatic generation of drag-optimized car designs.
